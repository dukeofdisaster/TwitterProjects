Simple Twitter Analytics; How to apply to multiple fields???

I used the twitter API as well as tweepy to create really simple extraction methods to pull tweets into a JSON file. 
In AddictAnalysis.py  I used keywords related to addiction; the thought being that an organization could use the data
for outreach to people suffering from addiction. A rehab facility's marketing team might be interested in it as a lead generator.
